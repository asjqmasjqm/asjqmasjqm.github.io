## About Me: Ming Zhou (周明)

I am currently a Ph.D. student of the [Knowledge Engineering Group](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a researcher at Baidu and Tencent. 

My research focuses on social & information networks, data mining, language models, and graph representation learning. I have published in premier venues of social bot detection, large language models, and graph neural networks, including [a best paper in ECML-PKDD 2023](https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/program/awards/). Based on these algorithms, we have developed and launched the social bot detection platform [Botdetection](https://botdetection.aminer.cn/robotmain), which has received widespread attention and is currently ranked No.1 in Google search.

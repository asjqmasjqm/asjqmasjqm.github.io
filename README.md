# The Homepage of Ming Zhou

I am currently a Ph.D. student of the Knowledge Engineering Group, Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a researcher at Baidu and Tencent.

My research focuses on social & information networks, data mining, language models, and graph representation learning. I have published in premier venues of social bot detection, large language models, and graph neural networks, including a best student paper in ECML-PKDD 2023. Based on these algorithms, we have developed and launched the social bot detection platform Botdetection, which has received widespread attention and is currently ranked No.1 in Google search.

## About Me: Ming Zhou (周明)

I am currently an assistant researcher at the Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences. I obtained my Ph.D. supervised by [Prof. Jie Tang](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/) at the [Knowledge Engineering Group](https://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Department of Computer Science and Technology in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. Before joining Tsinghua, I was a researcher at Baidu and Tencent. 

My research focuses on large language models (LLMs), AI for science, multi-modal data mining, graph representation learning, and social & information networks. I have published in premier venues of LLMs, AI for science, graph neural networks (GNNs), and social networks, including [a best student paper in ECML-PKDD 2023](https://2023.ecmlpkdd.org/program/awards/). Furthermore, relying on my self-developed algorithms, I developed and launched two systems:
(1) AIGC-assisted cheongsam design platform, which has surpassed the state-of-the-art text-to-image foundational model, Midjourney, in cheongsam design generation. The comparative experimental results are shown in the figure below:

(2) Social bot detection platform [Botdetection](https://botdetection.aminer.cn/robotmain), which has received widespread attention and is currently ranked No.1 in Google search.
